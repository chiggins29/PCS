	    		<h1>Tax Organizer</h1>
	    		<h3>We introduce this to you so you can start tracking and recording all of your income and expenses. We have you do this for a couple of main reasons that will only benefit you in the long run!</h3>
	    		<h5>
	    			<ol>
	    				<li>Tracking Expenses: The reason we have you start tracking all of your expenses is for your tax deductions at the end of the year. When you have all of your business expenses for the year accurately listed out, it makes much easier work for the CPA's. You will start tracking things like internet, power bill, mortgage (if you own), cell phone, and office supplies because all of these things that you will use for business can now be written off.</li>
	    				<li>Tracking Income: This area is pretty straight forward, you need to track all of your income coming in so you know what kind of money you are making on the bottom line. You can start seeing your margin percents and things of that nature to make sure you business is going to be viable. Have to be making enough money to cover all your expenses plus being able to pay yourself.</li>

	    		<h1>Traditional CPA Cost</h1>
	    		<h5>Most of the firm that we see are charging by the hour. The problem with that is one firm charges $100 and hour, which may be a little steep for your needs. The other firm only charges $30 an hour, but then you run the risk of quality of work! It is very difficult to determine which way to go with the accounting firms and CPA's that charge hourly. On top of the hourly rate, because that is mostly charged throughout the year when you have questions or need advise. They have a form filing fee that is going to be charged at the time you file your taxes. The National Society of Accountants reported the average CPS tax preparation fees over a couple of years.
	    		<ul>
	    			<li>Form 1040 with state return and no itemized deductions - $176</li>
	    			<li>Form 1040 with state return and Schedule A - $273</li>
	    			<li>Form 1040 with state return, Schedule A, and Schedule C - $457</li>
	    		</ul>
	    		As you can see with the monthly fee and the preperation fees that will come with filing the taxes at the end of each year.
