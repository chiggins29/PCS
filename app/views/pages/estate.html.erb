			<h2>Why Plan My Estate?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>An estate plan goes much further than a will. Not only does it deal with the distribution of assets and legacy wishes, but it may help you and your heirs pay substantially less in taxes, fees, and court costs. Estate planning also helps you maintain control of your property while you are alive regardless of your age, health or financial condition! The time is now to get an estate in place, because by the time you need one in place, it will be too late!</p>

			<h2>Benefits and Key Features</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Many people think that estate plans are only for the rich and famous. The fact is, nearly everyone can benefit from having an estate plan in place. Planning your estate comes with a couple of key benefits that can lay your mind at rest after you're gone. Ask yourself a couple of questions, (1) Do you want to make sure that the instructions you've left behind are carried out according to your wishes? (2) Would you like to see certain possesions that you have in the hands of certain people? (3) With the people that mean the most to you, don't you want to make sure that the assets they receive have the least amount of headache? (i.e., amount of taxes, legal fees, and court costs)</p>
