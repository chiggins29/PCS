	<h1>Prime Corporate Service Terms of Service</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>We hereby reserve the right, without prior notice, to assign this Agreement to a third party, or to transfer the contract for collection services, and upon notice, you agree to make all payments due hereunder to said third party, until further notice.</p>

	<p>You agree that your digital signature is equivalent to a handwritten signature as provided in The Federal E-Sign Act.</p>

	<p>You are responsible for your own financial decisions. We have not, cannot, and will not, make any guarantee that you will make or save money, whether explicit or implied. Consult your own advisors before making your financial decisions.</p>

	<p>We value your privacy. Personally identifiable or financial information you provide us will only be used for the purposes for which it was obtained. Because we invest time and resources in products and services, the products and services are proprietary, confidential and are to be used for the intended purpose for which they were offered. Prime Corporate Services has partnered with select service providers that may also provide specific tax and entity services on behalf of Prime Corporate Services. Prime Corporate Services may also suggest other third-party products or services it believes will assist in your success. Purchase of third-party products or services creates a relationship between you and the third party provider, and in such instances, disclaims any responsibility for the purchase or the relationship, even if Prime Corporate Services receives value for suggesting such third-party products or services. Prime Corporate Services reserves the right to limit the nature of the products and services it offers to anyone in its sole discretion.</p>

	<p>YOU, THE BUYER, MAY CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE DATE YOUR PAYMENT WAS PROCESSED (OR SUCH TIME AS PROVIDED UNDER STATE LAW), WHICH EXCLUDES SUNDAYS AND LEGAL HOLIDAYS, AFTER WHICH THERE IS NO REFUND. Cancellations do not APPLY TO ANY portion of USED PRODUCTS OR services including fees OR costs WE HAVE INCURRED. TO CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT, SEND A SIGNED AND DATED NOTICE OF CANCELLATION BY EMAIL TO SUPPORT@PRIMECORPORATESERVICES.COM.

Cancellations must be done by telephone or email. Monthly recurring fees of previous billing cycles are non-refundable. Prime Corporate Services is not obligated to, and will not send you, any renewal notice or advance billing notice prior to charging your credit card. Prime Corporate Services also does not accept debit only cards and the card number you provide must be a credit card. As your right to the services is conditioned on receipt of payment, if payment cannot be charged to your credit card, or if a charge is denied or inhibited for any reason Prime Corporate Services reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate the service without notice. Suspension or termination does not cancel your obligation to pay any amounts already owing or any cancellation fees.
