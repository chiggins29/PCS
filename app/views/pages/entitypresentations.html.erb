	    		<h3>LLC Member Asset Protection</h3>
	    		<p>LLCs provide limited liability protection to their owners (members), in the sense of not being personally responsible for the business debts and liabilities of the LLC. Creditors cannot pursue the personal assets (house, savings accounts, etc.) of the owners to pay the business debts.</p>
	    		<p>Don't be the person that thinks you are above getting sued or having a judgment filled against you. If you are selling something or providing a service, someone is going to be unhappy at some point! Don't settle for a soul proprietor or something that doesn't have protection and have the risk of losing your personal assets! If something were to happen like this under your LLC, the other party can only go after business assets and bank accounts.</p>

	    		<h3>Tax Benefits to operating an LLC</h3>
	   	  	<h5>LLCs on average can have a lower tax rate than corporations. For example, the corporate tax rate for 75k is 34%, while the personal tax rate for that amount is 25%. -Fun Fact</h5>
	   	  	<ul>
	   	  		<li><em>Start writing off everything you use for work!</em></li>
	   	  		<li>Computer and Office Supplies</li>
	   	  		<li>Cell phone and mortgage payment (if you own your home)</li>
	   	  		<li>Internet Bill and Power Bill</li>
	   	  		<li>The list goes on and on with different things that you can write off under your LLC</li>
	   	  	</ul>
	   	  	<p>Use the tax benefits that come along with owning your own business to your advantage! You can save a lot of money on taxes every year by keeping track of all of your deductions. You have to be very diligent but it is worth it in the end!</p>

	    		<h3>S-Corp Asset Protection</h3>
	   	  	<p>Simliar to an LLC, an S-Corp protects the personal assets of its shareholders. A shareholder is not personally responsible for the business debts and liabilities of the corporation. Creditors cannot pursue the personal assets of the shareholders to pay business debts.</p>
	   	  	<p>The asset protection benefits of an LLC and S-corp are very similiar. Either way, it is very smart to list your business under one of the two entities so you can have this protection as your are running your business.</p>

	   	  	<ul>
	   	  		<li>Pass-through Taxation- Basically what this means, is that your corporation will not pay federal taxes on a corporate level. So all profits and losses are passed through to the individual to be taxed on a personal level.</li>
	   	  		<li>Fringe Benefits- Under an S-Corp you are able to completly write off all of your medical expenses. So you would be able to write off your health insurance payments each year.</li>
	   	  		<li>There are many many more benefits to having an S-corp in the tax world. You can start writing off your cell phone, computer, internet, power bill, this list goes on.</li>
	   	  		<li>You can list yourself as an employee of your corporation and draw a salary from straight from it. What this is going to do is reduce your self-employement tax liability, all while still generating business expense and wages-paid deductions for the corporation.</li>
