		    	<h1>Corporate Credit</h1>
		   	  <h3>What is Corporate Credit?</h3>
		   	  <h5>Corporate credit, or Business Credit, is credit that is earned and assigned to a corporation or business rather than an individual or person. The type of credit is essential in establishing and maintaining business or banking relationships that have potential creditors, vendors, business partners, or even clients. Having good business credit will only benefits you when you are looking for drop shipping affiliates or any other business contacts during your venture.</h5>
		   	  <h3>How can it benefit me?</h3>
		   	  <h5>Just like with your personal credit, many banks and business affiliates are going to look at your business credit to determine if they want to do business with you or not. With your personal credit, if you want a credit card, or a car, or a loan of any kind, you must have good personal credit. Well it’s the same when it comes to business credit, if you want a loan or a business credit card, you are going to need to establish business credit. The way that is it going to benefit you the most, is being able to put business debt under the business. You never want to float business debt under your personal funds. The reason for this, is that your personal money is not protected under the LLC. If the business fails, you are just out that money!</h5>

		    	<h1>Paydex Score</h1>
		   	  <h3>How it is calculated</h3>
		   	  <h5>While your personal credit score takes in several factors to consider, Paydex is calculated based on one single factor. Essentially, the factor is contingent upon whether the business makes payments to its respective suppliers and creditors either "as agreed" or "better than agreed" based on the contract with that company!</h5>
		   	  <h3>What is a good Paydex score?</h3>
		   	  <h5>The Paydex score ranges from 0 (being the worst) to 100 (being the best). A Paydex of 80 or higher is considered a very good score for a company. You achieve this score by paying your vendors or supplies on time or before the scheduled payment is due!</h5>
		   	  <h5>With these items, we would first have to make sure that we are in line with business compliance so we can register your business to start obtaining business credit.</h5>

		  		<h1>Corporate Funding</h1>
		  		<h3>Advice I wish I had received about setting up business credit for corporate funding.</h3>
		  		<h5>Many people make the mistake of floating all business expenses on their personal funds. That is okay in the very beginning, but you need to work hard to get some business credit going. Reason for this is, if anything ever happened to that business, you are going to be out that money. All the protection benefits you get from the LLC do not apply if the money is your personal cash. Moral of the story, do not float business expenses on your personal dime! Once you can get a business account and credit card, start putting all the funds under the business!</h5>

		  		<h5>The second thing is, don’t go for the gold right out of the gate when it comes to applying for various types of credit. What I mean is this, go and try and find a small business credit card up front. Go and try to get an account with office depot or something like that up front. Charge some office items to it and then pay it off in full. Do not put yourself under water right out of the gate, we want you to 'build' your credit not get in so much debt you don’t know what to do anymore.</h5>
