		<h4>The solution for reducing your taxes in the market is to set up a dual entity. Each entity serves its own purpose, both of which are very vital for your success!</h4>

				<div class="col-md-6 traders-text-columns">
					<h1>LLC</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The main function for the LLC is that it is going to be your trading vehicle, so this will be how you generate income. The good thing for you is that income from the LLC is only taxed at an individual level. So that means no double taxation from the corporate dividends.</p>

					<h1>Corporation</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>What you are going to use the corporation for is all the deductions that most people do not think about. Some of these are fringe benefits like, medical, dental, vision, etcâ€¦ The rest of them are office supplies, software, seminars, etc... We will teach you how to leverage these areas in your favor!</p>
