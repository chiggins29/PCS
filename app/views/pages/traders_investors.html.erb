		<h4>The solution for reducing your taxes in the market is to set up a dual entity. Each entity serves its own purpose, both of which are vital to your success!</h4>

				<div class="col-md-6 traders-text-columns">
					<h1>LLC</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The main function for the LLC is its usage as your trading vehicle; this will be used to generate income. It is set up to solely trade and is used as a legal filter to protect the money in the market and eliminates tax implications on an individual trading platform.</p>

					<h1>Corporation</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The corporation will serve as the entity with the parental rights. It will regulate the vehicles activity. It indirectly inherits all the deductions that most people do not think about. We will teach you how to leverage the tool and aggressively capitalize on the undisclosed tax benefits that could potentially eliminate your tax burden.</p>
